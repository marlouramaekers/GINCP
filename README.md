# GINCP: Longitudinal survey data on Corporate Social Responsibility (2003-2021)

## The data
The "Giving in the Netherlands Corporate Panel study" (GINCP) is a longitudinal panel dataset based on surveys among corporations in the Netherlands. It spans a period of twenty years, from 2003 to 2021. The GINCP survey is conducted approximately every two years among a large group of corporations in the Netherlands, ranging from small businesses and solo self employed people to large corporations with hunderds and thousands of employeess. he survey features a unique set of questions about the giving and sponsoring behavior in terms of money, goods and time of corporations. It also includes questions on other forms of corporate social responsibility and motivations for engaging in CSR. <br>
The data are collected by the VU Centre for Philanthropic Studies. Descriptive results are presented in the biennial report ['Giving in the Netherlands'](https://osf.io/c6pju).

Current version of the data: **not yet available**. <br>
Check the roadmap below for planned updates.

## The project
 
The VU Centre for Philanthropic Studies has collected survey data on corporate social responsibility for the last twenty years. In a biennial report series, we have reported extensively on charitable giving by corporations in the Netherlands. However, the data have never been publicly shared, despite the large potential to exploit these data further. 

The goal of the project is to make the data and documentation publicly available (in line with the FAIR guidelines), under the name of Giving in the Netherlands Corporate Panel Survey (GINCP). With the project, we contribute to the goal of Open Data and, more specifically, to stimulating the study of corporate social responsibility.

## Roadmap

This section outlines the roadmap of this project. Because the project is in an early phase, there is little room for input from external contributors at the moment. However, in later stages (especially point 5), we invite external contributors and users to give feedback on the dataset and the documentation.

2. **Create a data harmonization plan:** Questions may not be asked in a similar way in every survey round or have different response options. To ensure that the data can be compared, the data needs to be harmonized.
3. **Harmonize the data:** Action time! The data are harmonized in a consistent and cohorent way. Code for harmonization and merging data will be annotated
4. **User manual:** Just variables and values do not tell users much about the data. Therefore, we create a user manual. This manual includes meta data, such as information on the data collection, questions that were included and how to use the data
5. **User test data and access infrastructure:** After having a prototype of the dataset, we want to know how users work with data. Is everything clear? Do the user manual and dataset match? That's why we will ask people outside of the main team to use the data and give feedback on its interoperability

**Completed milestones**
1. **Select variables:** We want to share a first version of the data as soon as posible. Therefore, we start the project with a small selection of variables. This selection of variables will be expanded later.

**Time line**
We expect to reach milestone 2 and 4 by January. As of now it is not yet possible to predict when milestone 3 and 5 will be reached.

## Data use, feedback and collaboration

Because the project is in an early phase, it is currently not yet possible to use the GINCP data. If you would like to use the data at some point or have questions about data use, you can contact the data manager on the project [here](mailto:m.j.m.ramaekers@vu.nl).

Due to the early stage of the project, we are not yet open to collaborate with others. You can, however, always provide feedback on the project or express your interest in future collaborations, you can contact us [here](mailto:m.j.m.ramaekers@vu.nl).
